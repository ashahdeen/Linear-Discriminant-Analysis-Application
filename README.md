# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-Application

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a Dimensionality Reduction Technique that is commonly used for supervised classification problems.

It separates 2 or more classes and models the group-differences in groups by projecting the spaces in a higher dimension into space with a lower dimension

This Repository contains a step by step implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis with examples and explanation
